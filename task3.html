        <p> For many, expecting a baby serves as the beginning for some of
          life's most precious moments. During this period, the health and wellbeing of the mother comes first and foremost, where all friends
          and family come together to rejoice. However, for many women, this sentiment only exists in their imagination. </p>
        <p> Domestic violence refers to any type of abuse between partners or ex-partners (Morgan & Chadwick, 2009). This is not only a
          devastating crime, but is a violation of a woman’s mental, physical and emotional health (White Ribbon Australia, 2019). Domestic
          violence can happen at anytime throughout a woman’s life. However, it often first arises while women are pregnant; with 17% of domestic
          violence victims being physically or sexually abused for the first time during pregnancy (Morgan & Chadwick, 2009). Therefore pregnancy
          actually serves as a high-risk life event for women, where physical violence may be initiated or escalated (McGee, 2000 as cited by
          Keeling & Mason, 2011). </p>

          <h2>Research Exploration</h2>
          <p> We investigated the space of domestic violence against pregnant and postpartum woman by using an exploratory mixed method research approach (Creswell, 2003). This involves the use of complementary research methods which form an aggregate, holistic image of the problem scenario.</p>
          <h3> Through this research, we collated some key themes.</h3>
          <p>A good support system is necessary for pregnant woman</p><p class="border">Pregnancy is an <strong>overwhelming and anxious time </strong>in a woman’s life, therefore any type of reassurance or <strong>support during pregnancy and postpartum is necessary</strong> and welcome for comforting the woman and strengthening relationship connections.</p>
          <p>Abusers exploit the vulnerability that comes with pregnancy</p><p class="border">Perpetrators of domestic violence often <strong>exploit the fragile notion of pregnancy and motherhood</strong> as a way of <strong>manipulating the woman</strong> into staying in an abusive relationship, as women are known to be more vulnerable in this stage of their life. Perpetrators take advantage of this, and manipulate victims using “coercive control,” (Kelly & Johnson, 2008) knowing the woman can’t leave if they need support to raise a child.</p>
          <p>There is no one primary method of support</p><p class="border"><strong>Victims of domestic violence require a multidisciplinary treatment approach</strong> which works as a system, with social workers, health professionals, psychologists and the police doing their best to keep victims safe. Unfortunately, social workers which work in this particular field are extremely busy and many support services are restrictive when faced with mothers dealing with domestic abuse.</p>
          <p>The cycle of violence is perpetual</p><p class="border">The <strong>cycle of violence</strong> is a major factor psychological factor which supplements a <strong>victim’s reluctance to leave an abusive relationship.</strong> The cycle of violence encompasses four stages, the tension phase, the battering phase, the honeymoon phase and finally the denial phase (Deshpande & Lewis-O’Connor, 2013). Often, a victim will not leave their abusive partner, as they deny any abuse and wrongdoing by the perpetrator.</p>

          <img class="w-convo" src="img/w-convo.png" align="center" />

          <section class="content-container">
          <h3>Conclusion of Opportunities</h3>
          <p>From Task 1, many opportunities were identified to lessen aspects of domestic violence by working with services of assistance to improve
            a woman’s situation. These opportunities are manifested by creating a digital space which strengthens the connection between support
            systems which assist victims, such as social workers and midwives. A major opportunity we identified encompasses a system to gather data
            on the victim’s situation and utilising this to improve discrete communication between stakeholders, giving victims greater control
            over their situation and encouraging safe disclosure. Moreover, informing pregnant women about how their partner may be abusive or
            manipulating may encourage them to seek help or work with their partner to reduce tension and the risk of aggressive outbursts. Each
            of these opportunities ultimately aim to end the cycle of violence and restore safety in the victim’s life. </p>

          <h3>A New Perspective</h3>
          <p>After combining our research results, we had noticed a common trend in domestic violence within pregnancy; the cycle of violence. More
            traditional responses to domestic violence rely on the victim coming forward to disclose incidents to authorities (i.e. midwives,
            police), after which, the police will then prosecute the abuser and the Department of Community and Family Services (DoCS) will make an
            assessment about the unborn child’s living situation. This solution falls short as many victims aren’t aware or can’t comprehend their
            reality of being abused, and therefore they do not want to take permanent action or take the risk of having their children removed
            by DoCS. </p>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="column-three">
              <p> The cycle of violence is multifaceted and presents itself in many forms. The main paradox is as follows: </p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because domestic violence is a private affair, services rely on the victim coming forward and reporting abuse<p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because victims aren’t aware they are being abused, they can’t report or take action<p>
            </div>

            <div class="column-three">
              <p>Furthermore, victims of domestic violence often are manipulated, which complicates the matter:</p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because the abuser is manipulative, they will exploit and contort the victim’s emotions<p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because the victim is emotionally exploited, they resist reporting acts of abuse<p>
            </div>
            <div class="column-three">
              <p>When we factor in pregnancy however, this lends itself to an even more complex paradox:</p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because pregnant women are more emotionally prone, they are more dependent on their abusive partners<p>
              <p class="sub-para">Because a woman is more dependent on her partner, she is more emotionally prone<>
            </div>
          </div>
          <!-- <h3>Reframing</h3> -->
          <p> Therefore, when designing with these paradoxes in mind; it’s important to note that the disclosure of domestic violence is one of
            the hardest hurdles for women to overcome, with many abused women refraining from talking to others about abuse (O’Campo et al. 2008).
            Many victims protect the abuser against authorities as they don’t want to disclose domestic violence out of fear. This paradigm
            manifests itself as there is an absence of of screening schemes which are strategically implemented (Shadigian & Bauer, 2004; Edin &
            Hogberg, 2002), limiting the discourse which enables disclosure. Therefore, our solution must make women feel like they are in a safe
            environment and facilitate discrete and meaningful disclosure; we must create a conductive environment where women feel as though they
            can talk to practitioners about abuse. By tackling the problem of domestic violence as a matter of safe and meaningful disclosure,
            then solutions should focus on the communications between associated stakeholders. This is expanded upon in the following criteria for
            success.</p>

        <section class="content-container">
          <h2 id="part1-3">Critera for Success</h2>
          <p>Before ideating anything, we firstly created a criteria for success which we used to constantly refer back to as key goals for our design concepts. This criteria acted as a guide which we used to adapt, conceptualise and improve our concepts.

        <section class="content-container">
          <h2 id="part1-4">Design Concept Exploration</h2>
          <p>We created three disparate concepts drawing on aspects of our previous research to explore varying solution spaces for different stakeholders. These are:</p>
          <div class="tab">
            <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'pregnancypal')" id="defaultOpen">PregnancyPal </button>
            <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'twine')"> Twine</button>
            <button class="tablinks" onclick="openTab(event, 'paro')">Paro</button>
          </div>
          <div id="pregnancypal" class="tabcontent">
            <img class="concepts" src="img/pregnancypal-concept.png" align="center"/>
            <p>PregnanyPal is a smartphone app designed to support pregnant women by providing pregnancy support and discreetly detecting nuances of
              domestic violence. PregnancyPal utilises two forms of data collection to detect signs of domestic violence; voice biometrics
              and self-reports. Voice biometrics will use the user’s phone microphone, allowing the app to identify aggressive behaviour.
              This however, may be an obstacle, as users may feel that this invades their privacy. The self reporting function will enable
              women to fill in daily reports on their wellbeing and relationships. If the app identifies consistent yelling or
              negative self reports, the app will begin to drip feed abuse tips on the loading screen, discreetly hinting about the symptoms of
              domestic violence. This is a key aspect of this solution, as appropriate disclosure is key to overcoming topics such as
              domestic violence. Overtime, if alarming data is being regularly collected, the app will inform both the victim and midwife that
              domestic violence may be occurring. The midwife can then set an appointment to meet with the victim and can provide social work
              services, links and resources through the app.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="twine" class="tabcontent">
            <img class="concepts" src="img/twine-concept.png" align="center" />
            <p>Twine is a smartphone app and wearable device that is supplied to domestic violence victims by a social worker. Twine aims to
              improve efficiency of communications between a social worker and victim, both during appointments and externally. The app and
              health-watch are designed to provide haptic feedback and walk the user through stress management techniques (i.e. breathing
              exercises) whenever the victim suffers from stress or panic attacks, mostly induced by domestic abuse. The app sends data to
              the social worker based on these stress breaks; the victim can also complete daily journals which are then analysed by Twine, so
              the social worker can quickly gauge how the victim is feeling. All of this data is confidential. The next time the victim visits the
              social worker, the social worker can adjust the session to better prioritise treatment, as they already have a mutual basis of
              understanding. During each session, the social worker’s Twine app will record the session and send it to a secure section in the
              victim’s app so they can review it later. A downside to this is that peripherals are quite expensive to provide.</p>

          <div id="paro" class="tabcontent">
            <img class="concepts" src="img/paro-concept.png" align="center" />
            <p>Paro is a smartphone app that aims to rebuild and restore the relationship between a couple, reducing the tension building phase
              in the cycle of violence before it reaches the battering phase. The app encourages couples to log their emotions through a series
              of daily activities. Paro will identify when the partners individually experience excessive stress and display these as
              ‘warning periods’ that both partners can see, communicating trends of when and why these periods of stress are occuring. This enables
              both partners to compensate during these times and be more mindful of their actions and behaviours. During these stress periods, the
              app can also walk both partners through relaxation strategies such as breathing exercises. The app will also provide connections to
              external relationship services based on the couples context. A limitation to this app is that both partners have to be willing to
              actively work on their relationship.</p>

          <h3>Decision Matrix</h3>
          <p>When choosing which concept to elaborate on, we firstly wanted to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of each in relation to our criteria for success. We did this by making Harris Profile decision matrices, wherein criteria and alternatives can be easily evaluated and cross-compared (Profile, 2019).When choosing which concept to elaborate on, we firstly wanted to weigh up the strengths and weaknesses of each in relation to our criteria for success.

          <img class="decision-matrix" src="img/decision-matrix.png" align="center" />

          <h2>Final Design Concept</h2>
          <img class="ppal-logo-middle" src="img/ppal-logo.png" align="center" />
          <h3>Rationale</h3>

          <p>For the interactive solution, PregnancyPal, was chosen to be elaborated on as the final concept. This is as PregnancyPal scored
            relatively high in most facets within the decision matrix, thereby satisfying the majority of the criteria for success. Overall, we
            believe it is the most appropriate solution to reduce the effects of domestic violence and stop the cycle of violence by facilitating
            disclosure. It also has the most potential for growth and iterative development. </p>
          <p> In regards to our task 2 feedback, our tutor mentioned that Pregnancy Pal as a concept is the most effective as it affirms the
            detection and disclosure of information to a victim. On the other hand our lecturer briefly mentioned that he preferred the app Twine
            as it focuses on a specific stakeholder. Because of this feedback, we decided to narrow down to the two concepts, Pregnancy Pal and
            Twine. It was deliberated that Twine would add unnecessary layers to the social worker’s system and that overall, Twine would be too
            expensive to implement. Additionally Twine isn’t directed towards pregnant women, which may reduce the specified efficacy of the
            solution.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we deemed PregnancyPal as the most appropriate solution for stopping the cycle of violence by promoting disclosure between a
            victim and a practitioner. PregnancyPal succeeds in keeping the victim safe, as it expands the window of opportunity for
            intervention from external services (Macy et al. 2007). By discreetly informing victims on all facets of domestic violence
            through tips, warnings and communication with the midwife, PregnancyPal allows the victim to understand and gain control over
            their options, which is a critical pain point in current strategies for reducing domestic violence (Anderson, 2015). Thus, in utilising
            a multidisciplinary treatment system, including midwives and social workers, PregnancyPal effectively creates an opportunity for
            disclosure to inform the victim of their potentially abusive relationship and discreetly provides steps they can take to end the
            cycle of violence.</p>
          <p>Pregnancy Pal will be implemented by health professionals, particularly midwives and doctors, as they have ongoing and private
            contact with pregnant women. Additionally, pregnancy may be the only period in the victims life where they have access and contact with
            these external services (Humphreys & Campbell, 2010; Espinosa & Osborne, 2002). Midwives have an existing check-up protocol, wherein
            women inform their midwife of any emotional problems in their lifestyle during pregnancy (Dahlen and Schmied, 2018). Additionally
            women in their first pregnancy are more open to advice (Soltani et al., 2017). Therefore, trust and relationships can be built between
            a practitioner and patient which facilitates the disclosure of abuse (Macy et al. 2007). PregnancyPal supports this notion, and stores
            verified information by healthcare practitioners. PregnancyPal further seeks to identify signs of domestic violence in the early
            stages of pregnancy, reducing the risk of the Department of Community and Family Services (DoCS) deeming the victim’s baby as
            ‘at risk '. In addressing domestic violence earlier, rather than later in the course of pregnancy, the consequences for the victim is
            reduced as DoCS won’t remove their child.</p>
          <p>Overall, PregnancyPal was deduced to be our final concept as it best satisfies our criteria for success on all fronts. As a part of the
            cycle of violence, the perpetrators main motivation is to gain control of the situation and their partner (Deshpande &
            Lewis-O’Connor, 2013). Therefore, PregnancyPal counters this and restores the victim’s control over their options and allows for the
            safe disclosure of violence, stopping the cycle of violence. </p>

          <h3>Conceptual Iteration</h3>
          <p>Before we launched into creating assets or testing screens, we firstly iterated and refined our conceptual model of the app. We did
            this through a modified version of card sorting, where we categorised the conceptual model of our application. Card sorting is
            typically used to craft categorical navigation (Spencer et al. 2009), by asking users to sort an index of functions into categories
            which ‘make sense’. We applied this method differently however, as we used card sorting internally in order to cluster the functions
            and it’s context of our conceptual model. </p>

            <img  class="concept-model" src="img/card-sorting.jpg" align="center"/>

          <p>After completing this exercise, we found that we struggled immensely about where to place the voice biometrics feature in context, and we
            were also unsure about the ethics surrounding this. Therefore, we decided to get rid of the voice biometric function of the app
            completely as it is too abstract and weak as a concept.</p>
        
          <p>Additionally, we realised that we had to create two applications, as our concept relies on an effective and interactive treatment system between health care professionals and pregnant women. For the sake of creating the most appropriate and highly rendered application as possible, we decided to use midwives as our target health care user. We decided that the most appropriate technology for pregnant women would be the mobile phone, in particular we chose to base our prototype dimensions for an older generation of phones, accounting for women of all socio-economic status. It was also decided that the most appropriate technology for midwives would be the desktop, as the desktop is a standard in health care.</p>
            <p>Branching out from here, we then rendered the PregnancyPal conceptual model into a concept map which upholds our current
            perception of the app.</p>

        <section class="content-container">
          <h2>Phase 1: Low-Fidelity Sketches and Testing</h2>
          <p>Before designing the UI for both the phone and desktop app, an initial flow diagram was created using Miro to conceptualise the main functions and UI elements which both of our applications will contain allowing us to visualise the entire user experience and improve our conceptual model of the application (Nielsen, 2011).</p>
          <p>This was used to create six different initial sketches for both apps, which allowed us to explore different UI elements and functions, and evaluate and critique our designs internally. </p>
          <img  class="mobile-sketches" src="img/mobilesketches.gif" align="center"/>
          <img  class="desktop-sketches" src="img/desktopsketches.gif" align="center"/>
          <p>As a result of the six initial sketches and feedback, we created a final paper prototype of our UI to test with our users. Paper prototypes are a form of low-fidelity prototyping, it allows quick exploration of ideas early in the design process and allows you to easily make changes when iterating at a low cost (Tomitsch, 2018).</p>

            <p>When we conducted our first round of user testing, we made a paper prototype and integrated it within a digital framework to make it easier for users to understand the context at a high level. We conducted semi-structured think-alouds and identified the high level cognitive processes our users performed while using the prototypes (Jaspers et al. 2004). We followed these with an interview to understand pain points and feedback on the concept, elaborating more on subtle thought processes and data which would have been missed in the think-aloud (Ramey et al. 2006).</p>
            <p>We used phase one testing as a logic test for both of our applications. This meant that the participants we used didn’t always belong to our demographic, however useful data was still obtained.</p>

            <p>A paper prototype was created using paper screens, which were implemented into the mobile app, Prott, to prototype and add interactivity. This allowed us to test our prototype on the intended device, and in turn, made it easier for our participants to understand than a traditional paper prototype. User testing with this paper prototype was completed in two iterations. As a consequence of these iterations, UI elements were manipulated or screens were added, as seen below.</p>

              <p>During our first round of testing, we identified many issues our users had when using the paper prototype. Using our tutor’s advice, we then iterated on our designs and made changes to fix the issues identified by the users before conducting a second round of testing or moving up in fidelity. We decided to make one of our testers a control tester, meaning that throughout all iterations, this user would be seeing our prototype evolve and providing feedback throughout the process. In particular for the mobile application, our tester is a mother.</p>
          
              <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
              <p>In the second iteration, many changes were made to the interface and concept of the application. A small, but impactful change was the renaming of the ‘Daily Quiz’ to ‘Check In’, disassociating the feature with the pressure of a ‘quiz’. Other changes were made to encourage greater interactions with the UI; such as placing appropriate shadows and icons on interactive functions, giving the perceived affordance that these buttons have depth and are clickable.</p>

            

            <h3>Desktop application</h3>
            <p>The paper prototype for the desktop application was also done in two iterations, as we needed to make a lot of changes. We also used Prott to place these paper prototypes into a digital format, however this time for the desktop computer. After importing our prototypes into a digital format, we gave our laptops to the users for testing. We found that this practice was a hindrance, as we had to take notes on our phones since the users had our computers to test. When planning future iterations of testing the desktop app, we tried to organise more sessions together, however this proved too hard to manage because of time and location constraints. We also established a control tester for the desktop application. In particular for the desktop version of PregnancyPal, our tester is a graduate midwife role.</p>

            <h4>Iteration 1</h4>
              <p>Similarly, to the first round of mobile testing, we identified multiple issues. A big issue faced was that the user’s mental model did not align with our conceptual model of navigation. While the content all made sense to include, users struggled to find certain functions.</p>
              <h4>Iteration 2</h4>
              <p>We made a few conceptual changes to the UI navigation of the desktop application, as the tab systems were too convoluted for users to grasp. In particular, we found that the home tab and calendar practically served the same function, hence we combined and rehashed the information architecture of these tabs to allow for greater usability and utility.</p>

            <h2>Phase 2: Mid-fidelity Wireframes and Testing</h2>
            <p>As we moved into a higher fidelity, we made sure that all errors were ironed out in the earlier prototypes. For this next phase, we created our prototypes using interactive, mid-fidelity wireframes for users to test. The computer developed wireframes showed the fundamental structure or functions of our app (Tomitsch et al, 2018)</p>

              <p> In our second phase of testing, we used the previous methods of testing and added two more methods; heuristic evaluation and multivariate testing. Heuristic evaluation was conducted internally, where we used our user test results to inform how well each of Nielsen’s 10 heuristics (Nielsen, 1994) was satisfied. We also employed multivariate testing to inform the home page colour scheme for later use in high fidelity. This effectively tested the user preference (Gale Academic Onefile, 2010) to inform the aesthetics of the application.</p>
             <p>When selecting participants for this round of testing, we tried to choose participants which are slowly closer to our demographic; that being pregnant or postpartum women and midwives. For the mobile application, we were able to test with a few mothers, however we soon expanded our testers to be women in their ‘twenties,’ as we couldn’t find enough participants in the time frame. Women in their ‘twenties’ are also a part of our demographic, as it is a common age for first time mothers. Likewise for the desktop application, we expanded our testers to involve anyone not only midwives, but anyone else who works as a health care professional.</p>

                <p>Testing in this mid fidelity phase was completed only using one iteration. This is as the majority of issues which users had identified would be solved through a more detailed rendering within the high fidelity prototype. Minor suggestions were made concerning the framing of certain functions (i.e. writing “tap to hide” instead of “press to hide”). However, we did not see value in retesting with the same fidelity for such minor changes as these can be fixed within the next phase. </p>

              <p>Similarly to the mobile application testing, the mid fidelity desktop prototype was completed using one iteration. The issues identified within this round of testing had little to do with the overall concept of the app, but more to do with adding extra utility by creating more linking pathways between functions. Overall, we were happy with the user testing results but since we all went our own way to test, we came back and noticed that we all had similar problems with the 6 participants and wished that we tested with a smaller amount initially then iterated again before doing another test so that we weren’t testing the same problematic prototype repeatedly.</p>

          <section class="content-container">
              <h2 id="part2-">Phase 3: Building High-fidelity</h2>
              <p>The next stage of our iteration process consisted of developing our iteration to mock-ups. Mock-ups are a form of high fidelity prototyping and it focuses on testing the visual aspects of our app (Tomitsch, 2018). When building both the high-fidelity prototype for both the mobile and desktop applications, it was extremely important to ensure that all assets and colours used were appropriate. Because of this, we conducted A/B testing with users to inform colour variations within both applications. A/B testing is an evaluation method that includes parallel testing of two versions of the same product (Tomitsch, 2018). It was only after we conducted this A/B colour testing that we realised that we hadn’t tested the contrast of our colour codes for its legibility and accessibility. Therefore, we additionally introduced accessibility testing within this phase, using online resources to align the colour contrast analysis of PregnancyPal with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 (Caldwell et al. 2008). Additionally, we checked the sizing of our text for its accessibility levels, and created more space for accessibility options within the setting tab. After changing the colours to the appropriate levels, we further used A/B testing to validate these changes and see how our users responded to them. </p>

If we had more time, we wish we could have tested our high-fidelity prototype with pregnant women. After testing in this phase, most details had been ironed out. The majority of our feedback was to do with minimal aesthetic changes.</p>

            <p>PregnancyPal is a system which provides holistic pregnancy support, and also helps healthcare professionals detect signs of domestic violence. As a mobile application, PregnancyPal allows mothers to easily stay informed and keep up to date. As a desktop application, adequate integration between current healthcare systems is enabled for working professionals.</p>
            <p>Target users were heavily involved in the making of both the mobile and desktop PregnancyPal applications, and it was extremely beneficial to involve real users in the testing process. This led to not only designing for better functionality and aesthetics, but users reported feeling a sense of ownership as they contributed to the design process.</p>

        <p>Domestic violence is a multifaceted and extremely complex issue, which doesn’t have a be-all-end-all solution. However, PregnancyPal helps to alleviate some of the stress and worry associated with treating domestic violence in pregnant and postpartum women. This is achieved through the early detection of domestic violence using a systematic approach, allowing victims of abuse to be better informed about a greater width of options with the help of their health care practitioner.</p>
        <p>A contributing factor to the reluctance of disclosure of domestic violence is that in most settings, healthcare and social support services exist independently (Macy et al. 2007); there is little integration between healthcare and domestic violence services (Macy et al. 2005). PregnancyPal repairs this rift by providing comprehensive services which not only promote health and safety, but promote them synonymously.</p>
        <p>PregnancyPal enables a changing practice, one where women feel as though there is a sufficient discourse being created about the nature of abuse, leading to disclosure of domestic violence (Keeling & Mason, 2011). Following disclosure to a practitioner, PregnancyPal allows women to safely and effectively access a dynamic support network, enabling her to make informed decisions about escaping the destruction of domestic violence. </p>

        <section class="content-container">
        <p>If we were to take another step forward and plan future steps for after the current high-fidelity prototype, we would implement a few additional features:</p>
        <p class="sub-para-indent">Firstly, we would adjust the settings so that the user could exercise more control and freedom over the application. This involves personalisation features such as dark mode, or perhaps allowing the user to customise their check in categories. Additionally, the accessibility settings would be changed to be more inclusive, for example, allowing for voice dictation.</p>
        <p class="sub-para-indent">Within future iterations, we would also present the check in data in a more succinct way, with colours of the graph better correlating with each data input. This would make the interpretations of the graph much easier, for both the patient and midwife. Further interactions with the data would also be designed and tested, allowing for a more thorough understanding of the ‘Check In’ results.</p>
        <p class="sub-para-indent">Another future step would be creating the interface for the integration of hospital admin into PregnancyPal for signing up patients and making appointments. Furthermore, calendar integration and syncing would also be fleshed out, so users can sync PregnancyPal’s calendar to their devices’ calendar or their Google calendar.</p>
        <p class="sub-para-indent">A major step into the future would be to integrate the framework of PregnancyPal with other support services dealing with domestic violence. This ensures that treatment is a cohesive system, and that the victims of domestic violence always have help on-hand. The inclusion of other victims of domestic violence would also be a huge stride for future iterations.</p>
